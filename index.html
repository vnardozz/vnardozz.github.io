      <p>I spent the last 7 years of my professional life as a Sales Specialist with a focus on providing exceptional quality
        to clients in Direct B2P sales. After reaching the pinnacle of my ability in this career, I felt it was time to apply
        the skills that I learned there to a new and engaging field. After pursuing secondary education in Full Stack Web
        development, I found a love for getting "hands-on" with projects and providing the same exceptional quality in a
        new way. As a developer, I hope to expand the reaches of businesses small and large. As I was once told, "The internet
        never closes, why not take advantage?"</p>
